During 2014-16 my collaborators and I conducted avian point count surveys across 8 Sierra Nevada fire areas of different ages. These efforts were combined with those from a regional monitoring program containing survey locations coincident with an additional 25 fires. Using these data and a multi-species occupancy modeling approach, I am assessing the influence of wildfire spatial patterns and successional trajectories on bird species occupancy and community composition. One publication stemming from this project is currently in preparation, with additional articles planned.
