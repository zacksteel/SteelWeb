Bird occurrence and abundance varies across environmental and disturbance gradients, which are in turn affected by global change. Using avian surveys from burned and unburned forests in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, I seek to improve our understanding or how bird communities responds to wildfire- and management-induced changes in habitat structure and landscape pattern. 

During 2014-16 my collaborators and I conducted avian point count surveys across 8 Sierra Nevada fire areas of different times since disturbance. These efforts were combined with those from a regional monitoring program containing survey locations coincident with an additional 19 fires. Using these data and a multi-species occupancy modeling approach, I am assessing the influence of wildfire spatial patterns and successional trajectories on bird species occupancy and community composition. Three technical reports have been completed as part of this project ( [here](/../../files/Fogg et al 2015 - Avain Monitoring of the Freds and Power fire areas.pdf),  [here](/../../files/Fogg et al 2016 - Avian Monitoring of Central Sierra Post-fire Areas.pdf), and especially [here](/../../files/Fogg et al 2017 - Avian Monitoring in Freds and Power Fires - Final Report.pdf)), with academic publications  currently in preparation.
