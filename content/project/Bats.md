Using acoustic surveys of bat echolocations and hierarchical modeling, I am assessing how bat occupancy and activity levels vary across disturbance gradients and habitat types in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. 

During 2014-17 we conducted acoustic surveys of forest bat species in 3 wildfire areas and within surrounding unburned forests. We are using these data to evaluate the effects of wildfire and post-fire management on the bat community. To date, this project has resulted in one peer-reviewed publication ( [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52875-2)), three technical reports ( [here](/../../files/Steel and Safford - Power Fire 2014-16 Bat Monitoring Report.pdf), [here](/../../files/Point Blue 2015-16 Lassen National Forest post-fire final report.pdf) and [here](/../../files/Steel et al. 2018 - Post-fire Bat Monitoring 2014-17.pdf) ), and the first version of a [spatial predictive tool](/../../files/FIRE-BAT_manual_v1.0.pdf) designed to inform forest service management of bat habitats in burned landscapes. Additional publications are in preparation.  

Starting in 2017, surveys were expanded to two National Park wilderness areas and recordings were conducted coincident with temporary weather stations and throughout the summer season, allowing for assessments of bat phenology and activity fluctuations in response to weather. Additionally, I am testing the potential of lightweight smartphone-compatible bat detectors as citizen science tools. Bat data in wilderness areas are particularly difficult to gather and backpackers armed with such tools could dramatically increase our reach into these remote areas.
