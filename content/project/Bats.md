During 2014-17 acoustic surveys of forest bat species were conducted in 3 Sierra Nevada fire areas and within surrounding unburned forested lands. Using these data and hierarchical modeling, I'm assessing how bat occupancy and activity levels vary across severity gradients, at different successional stages, and with post-fire management (i.e. salvage logging). Starting in 2017, surveys were expanded to two National Park wilderness areas and recordings were conducted coincident with temporary weather stations and throughout the summer season, allowing for assessments of bat phenology and activity fluctuations in response to weather. One publication stemming from this project is currently in preparation, with additional articles planned.
