Zack's research focuses on the consequences of global change (especially changing wildfire patterns) for biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. Some of his past research focused on how wildfire and forest management alter landscape pattern, and influence habitat use of birds and bats in the forests of Californiaâ€™s Sierra Nevada Mountains.
