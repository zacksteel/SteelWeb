# SteelWeb

My personal website can be found at **zacksteel.netlify.com**. I'm continuously tweeking it and have grand ambitions but less time. Currently, it's a pretty simple academic-style website built using the R package [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), the site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the hugo [academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/). Check back in as more content is added in the future.
