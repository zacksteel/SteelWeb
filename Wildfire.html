<p>Using satellite-derived measures of burn severity (RnDBR), and historical fire perimeter data, I’ve assessed how fire severity is influenced by previous fire history, and how landscape patterns of burn severity matrices are changing over time in response to climate change and forest management/fire suppression.</p>
