In the western United States, fuel reduction treatments, both mechanical and prescribed fire, are widely used to increase resilience to wildfire but their effect on resistance to drought and beetle mortality is not as well understood. We followed more than 10,000 mapped and tagged trees in a mixed‐conifer forest following mechanical thinning and/or prescribed burning treatments in 2001 through the extreme 2012–2016 drought in California. Mortality varied by tree species from 3% of incense‐cedar to 38% of red fir with proportionally higher mortality rates in the larger size classes for sugar pine, red fir, and white fir. Treatment reductions in stem density were associated with increased diameter growth and rapidly growing trees had lower rates of mortality. However, the ultimate effects of treatment on drought‐related mortality varied greatly by treatment type. All species had neutral to reduced mortality rates following mechanical thinning alone, but treatments that included prescribed burning increased beetle infestation rates and increased mortality of red fir and sugar pine. Fuel reduction treatments appear to benefit some species such as Jeffrey pine, but can reduce resistance to extreme drought and beetle outbreaks in other species when treatments include prescribed burning. In a non‐analog future, fuel reduction treatments may require modification to provide resistance to beetle infestation and severe droughts.","tags":[],"title":"Do forest fuel reduction treatments confer resistance to beetle infestation and drought mortality?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z.L.

Its effect on bats is understudied, creating challenges for habitat management and species conservation as threats to the taxa worsen globally and within fire-prone ecosystems. We conducted acoustic surveys of wildfire areas during 2014–2017 in conifer forests of California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains. We tested effects of burn severity and its variation, or pyrodiversity, on occupancy and diversity for the 17-species bat community while accounting for imperfect detection. Occupancy rates increased with severity for at least 6 species and with pyrodiversity for at least 3. Two other species responded negatively to pyrodiversity. Individual species models predicted maximum occupancy rates across burn severity levels but only one species occurred most often in undisturbed areas. Species richness increased from approximately 8 species in unburned forests to 11 in pyrodiverse areas with moderate- to high-severity. Greater accessibility of foraging habitats, as well as increased habitat heterogeneity may explain positive responses to wildfire. Many bat species appear well adapted to wildfire, while a century of fire suppression and forest densification likely reduced habitat quality for the community generally. Relative to other taxa, bats may be somewhat resilient to increases in fire severity and size; trends which are expected to continue with accelerating climate change.","tags":[],"title":"The effects of wildfire severity and pyrodiversity on bat occupancy and diversity in fire-suppressed forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1533193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533193200,"objectID":"1ed0cdb403b208f38320856dba22406c","permalink":"/project/bats/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/bats/","section":"project","summary":"Eavesdropping on bats using acoustic monitoring","tags":["Birds","Wildfire","Landscape Ecology"],"title":"Bat Acoustics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1533193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533193200,"objectID":"65973ea50ff55edded5965943a1f4e8a","permalink":"/project/birds/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/birds/","section":"project","summary":"Evaluating how bird occurrence and diversity vary across forest landscapes and disturbance gradients","tags":["Birds","Wildfire","Landscape Ecology"],"title":"Birds in burns","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1533193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533193200,"objectID":"25fc4ad8297d762f5e58abb2e0646c08","permalink":"/project/reforestation/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/reforestation/","section":"project","summary":"Building web tools to aid post-drought forest management decisions","tags":["Forests","Drought","Landscape Ecology"],"title":"Climate-wise Reforestation Toolbox","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1533193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533193200,"objectID":"3ac4ad79bd2199166fc0f215d0241ee3","permalink":"/project/drought/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/drought/","section":"project","summary":"Investigating the mechanisms of drought-caused tree mortality, and efficacy of forest treatments","tags":["Forests","Drought","Landscape Ecology"],"title":"Forest Drought Mortality","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1533193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533193200,"objectID":"680bc074be2b6d90cd656c82df5f3752","permalink":"/project/wildfire/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/wildfire/","section":"project","summary":"Quantifying variation in fire history patterns (pyrodiversity) and assessing changes in wildfire regimes with implications for biodiversity and forest resilience","tags":["Wildfire","Landscape Ecology","Biodiversity"],"title":"Pyrodiversity","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1530169200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530169200,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":["ZL Steel","AE Steel","J Williams","JH Viers","P Marquet","O Barbosa"],"categories":null,"date":1485936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485936000,"objectID":"30bd498f95b5d073ac64b2c72a48069d","permalink":"/publication/chile-birds/","publishdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chile-birds/","section":"publication","summary":"The Mediterranean climate region of central Chile is rich in biodiversity and contains highly productive agricultural lands, which creates challenges for the preservation of natural habitats and native biodi- versity. Ecological data and studies for the region are also limited, making informed conservation in agricultural landscapes difficult. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data provide opportu- nities to relate species occurrences to measures of landscape heterogeneity even when field measures of habitat structure are lacking. When working with such remotely sensed data, it’s important to select appropriate measures of heterogeneity, including common metrics of landscape composition as well as frequently overlooked shape metrics. In this contribution we combine bird surveys with multispectral satellite imagery to develop boosted regression tree models of avian species richness, and of habitat use for 15 species across a mixed vineyard-matorral landscape in central Chile. We found a range of associations between individual species and land cover types, with the majority of species occurring most frequently in remnant habitats and ecotones rather than the interiors of large vineyard blocks. Models identified both metrics of landscape composition and patch shape as being important predictors of species occurrence, suggesting that shape metrics can complement more commonly used metrics of landscape composition. Vineyards that include corridors or islands of remnant habitat among vine blocks may increase the amount of area available to many species, although some species may still require large tracts of intact natural habitat to persist.","tags":[],"title":"Patterns of bird diversity and habitat use in mixed vineyard-matorral landscapes of Central Chile","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1483257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483257600,"objectID":"cd6d9d084287506b4668ad90c6aff50a","permalink":"/talk/example-talk/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/example-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.
