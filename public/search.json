Its effect on bats is understudied, creating challenges for habitat management and species conservation as threats to the taxa worsen globally and within fire-prone ecosystems. We conducted acoustic surveys of wildfire areas during 2014–2017 in conifer forests of California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains. We tested effects of burn severity and its variation, or pyrodiversity, on occupancy and diversity for the 17-species bat community while accounting for imperfect detection. Occupancy rates increased with severity for at least 6 species and with pyrodiversity for at least 3. Two other species responded negatively to pyrodiversity. Individual species models predicted maximum occupancy rates across burn severity levels but only one species occurred most often in undisturbed areas. Species richness increased from approximately 8 species in unburned forests to 11 in pyrodiverse areas with moderate- to high-severity. Greater accessibility of foraging habitats, as well as increased habitat heterogeneity may explain positive responses to wildfire. Many bat species appear well adapted to wildfire, while a century of fire suppression and forest densification likely reduced habitat quality for the community generally. Relative to other taxa, bats may be somewhat resilient to increases in fire severity and size; trends which are expected to continue with accelerating climate change.","tags":[],"title":"The effects of wildfire severity and pyrodiversity on bat occupancy and diversity in fire-suppressed forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1533193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533193200,"objectID":"1ed0cdb403b208f38320856dba22406c","permalink":"/project/bats/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/bats/","section":"project","summary":"Eavesdropping on bats using acoustic monitoring","tags":["Birds","Wildfire","Landscape Ecology"],"title":"Bat Acoustics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1533193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533193200,"objectID":"65973ea50ff55edded5965943a1f4e8a","permalink":"/project/birds/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/birds/","section":"project","summary":"Evaluating how bird occurrence and diversity vary across forest landscapes and disturbance gradients","tags":["Birds","Wildfire","Landscape Ecology"],"title":"Birds in burns","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1533193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533193200,"objectID":"25fc4ad8297d762f5e58abb2e0646c08","permalink":"/project/reforestation/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/reforestation/","section":"project","summary":"Building web tools to aid post-drought forest management decisions","tags":["Forests","Drought","Landscape Ecology"],"title":"Climate-wise Reforestation Toolbox","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1533193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533193200,"objectID":"3ac4ad79bd2199166fc0f215d0241ee3","permalink":"/project/drought/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/drought/","section":"project","summary":"Investigating the mechanisms of drought-caused tree mortality, and efficacy of forest treatments","tags":["Forests","Drought","Landscape Ecology"],"title":"Forest Drought Mortality","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1533193200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533193200,"objectID":"680bc074be2b6d90cd656c82df5f3752","permalink":"/project/wildfire/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/wildfire/","section":"project","summary":"Assessing changes in wildfire patterns in western forests and implications for forest resilience","tags":["Wildfire","Landscape Ecology"],"title":"Wildfire Patterns","type":"project"},{"authors":["ZL Steel","M Koontz","HD Safford"],"categories":null,"date":1530428400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530428400,"objectID":"4c7d0ab741d3338b6148d024c9718dad","permalink":"/publication/landscape-fire/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/landscape-fire/","section":"publication","summary":"*Purpose:* Wildfire spatial patterns drive ecological processes including vegetation succession and wildlife community dynamics. Such patterns may be changing due to fire suppression policies and climate change, making characterization of trends in post-fire mosaics important for understanding and managing fire-prone ecosystems.  *Methods:* For wildfires in California’s yellow pine and mixed-conifer forests, spatial pattern trends of two components of the post-fire severity matrix wereassessed for 1984–2015: (1) unchanged or very low-severity and (2) high-severity, which represent remnant forest and stand-replacing fire, respectively. Trends were evaluated for metrics of total and proportional burned area, shape complexity, aggregation, and core area. Additionally, comparisons were made between management units where fire suppression is commonly practiced and those with a history of managing wildfire for ecological/resource benefits.  *Results:* Unchanged or very low-severity area per fire decreased proportionally through time, and became increasingly fragmented. High-severity area and core area increased on average across most of California, with the high-severity component also becoming simpler in shape in the Sierra Nevada. Compared to suppression units, managed wildfire units lack an increase in high-severity area, have less aggregated post-fire mosaics, and more high-severity spatial complexity.   *Conclusions:* Documented changes in severity patterns have cascading ecological effects including increased vegetation type conversion risk, habitat availability shifts, and remnant forest fragmentation. These changes likely benefit early-seral-associated species at the expense of mature closed-canopy forest-associated species. Managed wildfire appears to moderate some effects of fire suppression, and may help buy time for ecosystems and managers to respond to a changing climate.","tags":[],"title":"The changing landscape of wildfire: Burn pattern trends and implications for California’s yellow pine and mixed conifer forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1530169200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530169200,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":["ZL Steel","AE Steel","J Williams","JH Viers","P Marquet","O Barbosa"],"categories":null,"date":1485936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485936000,"objectID":"30bd498f95b5d073ac64b2c72a48069d","permalink":"/publication/chile-birds/","publishdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chile-birds/","section":"publication","summary":"The Mediterranean climate region of central Chile is rich in biodiversity and contains highly productive agricultural lands, which creates challenges for the preservation of natural habitats and native biodi- versity. Ecological data and studies for the region are also limited, making informed conservation in agricultural landscapes difficult. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data provide opportu- nities to relate species occurrences to measures of landscape heterogeneity even when field measures of habitat structure are lacking. When working with such remotely sensed data, it’s important to select appropriate measures of heterogeneity, including common metrics of landscape composition as well as frequently overlooked shape metrics. In this contribution we combine bird surveys with multispectral satellite imagery to develop boosted regression tree models of avian species richness, and of habitat use for 15 species across a mixed vineyard-matorral landscape in central Chile. We found a range of associations between individual species and land cover types, with the majority of species occurring most frequently in remnant habitats and ecotones rather than the interiors of large vineyard blocks. Models identified both metrics of landscape composition and patch shape as being important predictors of species occurrence, suggesting that shape metrics can complement more commonly used metrics of landscape composition. Vineyards that include corridors or islands of remnant habitat among vine blocks may increase the amount of area available to many species, although some species may still require large tracts of intact natural habitat to persist.","tags":[],"title":"Patterns of bird diversity and habitat use in mixed vineyard-matorral landscapes of Central Chile","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1483257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483257600,"objectID":"cd6d9d084287506b4668ad90c6aff50a","permalink":"/talk/example-talk/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/example-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.
