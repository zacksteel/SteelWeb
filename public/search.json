Such patterns may be changing due to fire suppression policies and climate change, making characterization of trends in post-fire mosaics important for understanding and managing fire-prone ecosystems.  *Methods:* For wildfires in California’s yellow pine and mixed-conifer forests, spatial pattern trends of two components of the post-fire severity matrix wereassessed for 1984–2015: (1) unchanged or very low- severity and (2) high-severity, which represent rem- nant forest and stand-replacing fire, respectively. Trends were evaluated for metrics of total and proportional burned area, shape complexity, aggregation, and core area. Additionally, comparisons were made between management units where fire suppres- sion is commonly practiced and those with a history of managing wildfire for ecological/resource benefits. *Results:* Unchanged or very low-severity area per fire decreased proportionally through time, and became increasingly fragmented. High-severity area and core area increased on average across most of California, with the high-severity component also becoming simpler in shape in the Sierra Nevada. Compared to suppression units, managed wildfire units lack an increase in high-severity area, have less aggregated post-fire mosaics, and more high-severity spatial complexity.  *Conclusions:* Documented changes in severity pat- terns have cascading ecological effects including increased vegetation type conversion risk, habitat availability shifts, and remnant forest fragmentation. These changes likely benefit early-seral-associated species at the expense of mature closed-canopy forest- associated species. Managed wildfire appears to moderate some effects of fire suppression, and may help buy time for ecosystems and managers to respond to a changing climate.","tags":[],"title":"The changing landscape of wildfire: Burn pattern trends and implications for California’s yellow pine and mixed conifer forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1530169200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530169200,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":["ZL Steel","AE Steel","J Williams","JH Viers","P Marquet","O Barbosa"],"categories":null,"date":1485936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485936000,"objectID":"30bd498f95b5d073ac64b2c72a48069d","permalink":"/publication/chile-birds/","publishdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chile-birds/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Patterns of bird diversity and habitat use in mixed vineyard-matorral landscapes of Central Chile","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1483257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483257600,"objectID":"cd6d9d084287506b4668ad90c6aff50a","permalink":"/talk/example-talk/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/example-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.

Reference fire regimes in forested ecosystems can be categorized along a gradient ranging from “fuel‐limited” to “climate‐limited” where the former types are often characterized by frequent, lower‐severity wildfires and the latter by infrequent, more severe wildfires. Using spatial data on fire severity from 1984–2011 and metrics related to fire frequency, we tested how divergence from historic (pre‐Euroamerican settlement) fire frequencies due to a century of fire suppression influences rates of high‐severity fire in five forest types in California. With some variation among bioregions, our results suggest that fires in forest types characterized by fuel‐limited fire regimes (e.g., yellow pine and mixed conifer forest) tend to burn with greater proportions of high‐severity fire as either time since last fire or the mean modern fire return interval (FRI) increases. Two intermediate fire regime types (mixed evergreen and bigcone Douglas‐fir) showed a similar relationship between fire frequency and fire severity. However, red fir and redwood forests, which are characterized by more climate‐limited fire regimes, did not show significant positive relationships between FRI and fire severity. This analysis provides strong evidence that for fuel‐limited fire regimes, lack of fire leads to increasing rates of high‐severity burning. Our study also substantiates the general validity of “fuel‐limited” vs. “climate‐limited” explanations of differing patterns of fire effects and response in forest types of the western US.","tags":[],"title":"The fire frequency-severity relationship and the legacy of fire suppression in California forests","type":"publication"}]
